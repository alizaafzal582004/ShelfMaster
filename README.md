# ShelfMaster

This **C++** project implements a library management system using **DSA** a **linked list** for books and a vector for student records. It supports adding, displaying, and sorting books (via **bubble sort**), issuing and returning books, and saving student data to a **fileâ€”all** accessible through a menu-driven interface.
